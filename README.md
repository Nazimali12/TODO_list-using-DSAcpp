A TODO List is a project where users can manage a list of tasks. The list allows users to add, delete, edit, mark tasks as completed, and sort tasks based on attributes like priority and deadlines. Using Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), we aim to optimize the operations for managing tasks efficiently.

The goal of this project is to create an application that handles these basic operations while ensuring optimal performance by implementing appropriate data structures like linked lists, priority queues, or binary search trees (BST).

Approach Using Data Structures and Algorithms:
The TODO List can be implemented using various data structures depending on the functionality you wish to emphasize. Below are some common operations and the DSA approaches that can be applied to solve them efficiently.

Steps for the Algorithm:
Add Task:

Insert a new task into the list.
Data Structure: Linked List or Priority Queue.
Algorithm: Insertion at the end (O(1) time complexity in a linked list), or maintaining order in the priority queue (O(log n) time complexity for insertion).
Delete Task:

Remove a task from the list by specifying its ID or description.
Data Structure: Linked List or Hash Map (for quick lookups).
Algorithm: Traversing the list to find the task (O(n) in a linked list) or O(1) for deletion in a hash map.
Edit Task:

Modify an existing task, updating its description, priority, or deadline.
Data Structure: Linked List or Hash Map.
Algorithm: Traverse the list to find the task (O(n) in a linked list) or O(1) with a hash map.
Mark Task as Completed:

Update a task’s status to indicate it has been completed.
Data Structure: Linked List or Hash Map.
Algorithm: Similar to editing a task, traverse or access the task in O(n) or O(1) time.
Sort Tasks:

Sort tasks by priority, deadline, or status.
Data Structure: Priority Queue or Binary Search Tree (BST).
Algorithm: Sorting can be performed using algorithms like Merge Sort (O(n log n)) or by using a priority queue to maintain sorted order during insertion (O(log n)).
View Tasks:

Display all tasks in the list, with the option to filter tasks (e.g., completed vs. pending).
Data Structure: Linked List or Array.
Algorithm: Traverse the list and print each task’s attributes (O(n)).
Backtracking Strategy (For Task Dependencies):
If tasks have dependencies (e.g., one task must be completed before another), a backtracking strategy can be implemented to manage and check for valid task orders. This could be represented as a graph where tasks are vertices, and dependencies are edges. Backtracking would ensure valid task execution without violating the dependency rules.
